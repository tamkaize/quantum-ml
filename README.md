# Quantum Inspired Feature Engineering

## Overview
This project explores how quantum-inspired feature transformations can enhance cross-sectional equity factor models for alpha construction.
We simulate quantum feature maps using Qiskit and apply classical machine learning models to predict relative returns.

## Project Structure
- `/data` - Raw and processed stock market data
- `/src` - Core feature engineering, model training, and backtesting code
- `/notebooks` - Experiment notebooks
- `/reports` - Generated charts, metrics, and findings

## Motivation
While quantum computing is not yet practical for live trading, quantum-inspired feature mappings can unlock new representations of financial data. 
This project investigates whether these mappings offer an edge in traditional equity factor modeling and trading.
